***Patterns***

- - - 

***Two Pointers***
- → *traversing an array with two pointers from either end moving in different directions*
- → *used on **ordered data structures** **(sorted arrays)***
- → ***used to find a subset of elements that fufill certain conditions***

***Fast & Slow Pointers***
- → *two pointers moving at different speeds in a data structure*
- → *used to **detect cycles in a structure/find middle elements/solve linked list problems***
- → (*two pointers for linked lists*)

***Sliding Window*** (*Sliding Window Fixed Size & Sliding Window Variable Size*)
- → *creating a window into the data structure & then moving that window to gather information*
- → *used on **arrays***
- → ***used to find a contiguous subset that fulfils certain conditions***

***Merge Intervals***
- → *involves merging overlapping intervals*
- → *used for **time intervals/ranges/sequences***

***Cyclic Sort***
- → *sorting an array containing numbers in a given range*
- → *used in **situations where the data involves a finite range of natural numbers***

***In-Place Traversal of a Linked List***
- → *reversing elements of a linked-list in place*
- → *used for **reversing a sequence without using extra space***

***Monotonic Stack***
- → *using a stack to maintain a monotonic (either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing) order of elements*

***Tree BFS***
- → *level-by-level traversal of a tree*
- → *used when need to **traverse a tree/graph in a level-by-level manner***

***Tree DFS***
- → *traversing a tree or graph depth-wise before visiting siblings/neighbours*
- → *used when need to **search deeper into a tree/graph first before going across***

***Island (Matrix Traversal)***
- → *traversing a matrix to find islands or contiguous groups of elements*
- → *used in **grid-based problems - when grouping elements together***

***Two Heaps***
- → *using two heaps to divide a set of numbers into two parts*
- → *used when **finding median numbers in a sequence***

***Subsets***
- → *generating all subsets of a set*
- → *used to **solve problems that require exploring all subsets of a given set***

***Modified Binary Search***
- → *tweaked version of binary search algorithm*
- → *used **when a simple binary search is not sufficient***

***Bitwise XOR***
- → *solve various array-based problems*
- → *used **when need to manipulate/compare bits directly***

***Top K Elements***
- → *find the top k elements among a certain category*
- → *used for **problems involving sorting/searching/heaps***

***K-Way Merge***
- → *merging k sorted lists*
- → *used for **problems involving lists - where merging is required***

***0/1 Knapsack (DP)***
- → *problems where items have different values and weights, and need to determine the maximum value we can carry*
- → *used for **optimisation problems with physical constraints***

***Backtracking***
- → *exploring all possible solutions and then backtracking to the correct course when you are on the wrong path*
- → *used to **solve complex combinatorial problems & puzzles***

***Topological Sort (Graph)***
- → *sorting nodes in a directed graph in a specific order where the preceding node comes before the following node*
- → *use in **scheduling problems & scenarios where order needs to be imposed on how your process nodes***

***Union Find***

***Ordered Set***

***Multi-Threaded***
- → *designing algorithms that can execute multiple threads in parallel*
- → *used in situations where a **task can be divided into independent sub-tasks that can execute concurrently***
