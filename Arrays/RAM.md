***RAM***

- - - 

***Data Structure***

→ ***a way of storing data in an efficient manner - inside the RAM***

- - - 

***RAM***

→ ***contiguous block of data (containing values & addresses)***
→ ***where all variables are stored (measured in bytes) - within advanced data structures***

<br>

- *1 **Byte** → 8 Bits*
- ***Bit** → position that can store a digit (0 or 1)*
- ***Address →*** *identify the distinct memory location where a value is stored**

- - - 

***Array***

***→ collection of ordered, contiguous group of elements***

***e.g. Array of Integers***

- *Integers → Represented (typically) at 4 Bytes (32 Bits)*
- *Represent Integer in Terms of Bytes - put into an array with other integers - & store into RAM*

<br>

- → *RAM address increments by 4 as array of 4 Byte Integers - must increment by 4 for each integer*
- → *for an array of characters - this would increment by 1 (characters are 1 Byte, typically for ASCII)*

<br>

- → *arrays - stored in RAM the same way they are represented (contiguous values)*
- → *can store values contiguously regardless of size - just need to increment address correctly*
